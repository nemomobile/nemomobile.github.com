<h2>Edge swipes</h2>
Swipes from the edge of the screens are reserved for system-wide actions, as illustrated on the following image.

Developers are free to use any in-app swipes for their apps.

<h2>In-app back swipe hint</h2>
When pages inside apps stack up the depth should be visible on the left edge as shown in the image, as
a hint to the user to swipe from the left edge to go back
