<h2>There are three types of icons in the nemomobile iconset. </h2>
<h3>This is the nemo default application iconset</h3>

<img style=""src="images/iconset.png" alt="nemomobile default application icons" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
To create an icon for your application, you can either
<h3>Find a circular object</h3>
<p>
This is the preferred icon style for nemo, but it is not always feasible.
Find an object representative of your app that
is circular, like the dialer, or the combination locker. It doesnâ€™t have to be 
absolutely circular, some parts can stick out of the circle and actually this 
practice is recommended.
</p>
or...
<h3>Shoehorn an item into a circle</h3>
<p>
The second type of icons are objects that are not circular but can be easily
recognized even if modified to a circular shape, like the sticky notes, or the
packages. This can be done by either cropping or reshaping the object.
</p>
or if you can't do even that,
<h3>Just take a circle and paste your icon over it</h3>
<p>

The third solution, least recommended but always easy to do, is to just paste
any icon over a colored circle. This is actually recommended for logos of
established brands/apps who do not allow their logos to be modified. The circle
has a radial gradient from the center to the rim, with the lighter part at the
center and maximum difference in lightness between rim and center at about 50.
