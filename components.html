    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Most components description websites list the components and describe how and when you should
    use them. Every component, however, was invented to solve a specific user interface problem, not 
    for the sake of existing. For this reason in this website, you will find a list of common use cases
    and then the component that fit's them better.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Don't think in components, think in usage scenarios</h3>
    <p>
        Many developers think out their features in components and layouts. They visualize the application
            in their minds before even starting designing it. If you do that, <strong>you're doing
            it wrong!</strong>
        Think as a user. What would you expect from your app? Lay out your problem and then try to solve it,
            not the other way around. Don't provide solutions in search of a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the following use-case. You are developing a contacts application, and want to implement 
            a groups feature. The first thing that comes to mind is a page to create and manage groups, 
            and add contacts to them.
    </p>
    <h4>The use case</h4>
    <p>A user wants to group his contacts. For the user to require grouping the possibility is that
       he has many contacts, so we can safely assume that for the majority of users of this feature
       the contacts to be grouped will be already there. You can always run a small survey to test your
       assumptions. A sample of 100 people is more than enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        After defining the groups and adding their original members, the user will want to add users into
        groups as they are added to his address book.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user will most probably want to view his contacts by group and be able to remove a user from
            a group.
    </p>
    <h4>The solution</h4>
    <p>
        As the contacts are already in place, we will assume that selecting a contact, the user will
            want to be able to add it to a group. This can be easily done from the context menu of 
            the contact. The user must have a choice to create a new group instead of adding a user to
            an existing one. This takes care of the creation of a group.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users that group their contacts will want to be able to view their contact list sorted/grouped
        by group. Thus we can add another option to our default sorting/grouping options of our application.
            This takes care of viewing the members of a specific group gathered together. The user must
        have a context-aware way to remove a user from a specific group. Users that belong to more than
        one groups will show up multiple times in the list. For more control we can consider a control
        that collapses all the groups to their titles. We can also allow sorting on the collapsed groups
        so that the user has control over which group is visible when the contacts application launches.
    </p>
    <h4>The two approaches</h4>
    <p>
        The use-case approach will provide the same functionality (and even more), with just two context
            menu items, one more sorting setting, and a sheet that allows group selection and creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The classic approach, will require an extra page in the application, with a list of all groups, 
            context menu for each group with basic functions, a sheet to add contacts to each group
            in excess to what will be needed with the above approach, making the application more 
            difficult to develop, cluttered and more difficult to use.
    </p>
    <h4>Verdict</h4>
    <p>
        Create use cases, find the interface challenges you have to solve and choose from the list on the
            left to read a suggestion as to what control you should use.
